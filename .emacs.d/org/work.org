** CANCELLED New target not visible on create
   CLOSED: [2016-02-16 Вт. 19:14]
   - State "CANCELLED"  from ""           [2016-02-16 Вт. 19:14] \\
     Cause of duplication
Rare bug? While create new target, this target does not appears in admin
panel.
> or when an target previously deleted?

** DONE Edit target does not adds switch(On/Off)At fields
   CLOSED: [2016-02-15 Пн. 19:00]
When you trying to edit target url, the time fields does not injects. So, the 'check target' does not work for
corrupted targets.

** DONE Set target status
   CLOSED: [2016-02-14 Вс. 20:04]
Throws 'Can not read property', and stops execution, so if some targets is not colored yet, they don't wan't to be
colored.

** NEXT New target does not displayed
Rare bug? Recently added target does not displayed. Apprears on more then 3 targets? Cause of long database save?

** DONE New target check status
   CLOSED: [2016-02-15 Пн. 18:57]
HTTP status doen't checked for newly created targets.

** CANCELLED Not enough filters in check target
   CLOSED: [2016-02-15 Пн. 18:57]
   - State "CANCELLED"  from ""           [2016-02-15 Пн. 18:57]
Check target map does not use enough filters while trying to search and target. So, it can be two equal targets with different filters and that sutiation can corrupt search result.

** Null target
   Null targets does not allowed.
** WAITING Equals target check statuses
   - State "WAITING"    from "NEXT"       [2016-02-16 Вт. 19:15] \\
     Wait for decision about injecting ids into database record
'Check target' does't work correctly with equals targets, cause of database 
search query. This problem refers to "Not enough filters in check target" bug.

*** TODO Fix edit target event
So when we edit target the message with HTTP status should disappers.

*** TODO Check target on create
Server does not checks targets on 'target create' action.

> So as 'check target' depends on id, that does not exists after creation, front send null id, then, after querying url id saves 'with query result'.

* TODO Todo

** Add version field

** Split view and bl in feature/check-target
