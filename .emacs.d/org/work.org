* TODO
** Bug list								:BUG:
   List of found bugs is available in googledocs.

** Promo creation bug							:BUG:
   On create promo empty target already exists on frontend.
   This bug about reduce operation on front.

** CANCELLED New target not visible on create				:BUG:
   CLOSED: [2016-02-16 Вт. 19:14]
   - State "CANCELLED"  from ""           [2016-02-16 Вт. 19:14] \\
     Cause of duplication
   Rare bug? While create new target, this target does not appears in admin
   panel.
   - or when an target previously deleted?

** DONE Edit target does not adds switch(On/Off)At fields		:BUG:
   CLOSED: [2016-02-15 Пн. 19:00]
   When you trying to edit target url, the time fields does not injects. So, the 'check target' does not work for
   corrupted targets.

** DONE Set target status						:BUG:
   CLOSED: [2016-02-14 Вс. 20:04]
   Throws 'Can not read property', and stops execution, so if some targets is not colored yet, they don't wan't to be
   colored.

** IN PROGRESS New target does not displayed				:BUG:
   Rare bug? Recently added target does not displayed. Apprears on more then 3 targets? Cause of long database save?

** DONE New target check status						:BUG:
   CLOSED: [2016-02-15 Пн. 18:57]
   HTTP status doen't checked for newly created targets.

** CANCELLED Not enough filters in check target				:BUG:
   CLOSED: [2016-02-15 Пн. 18:57]
   - State "CANCELLED"  from ""           [2016-02-15 Пн. 18:57]
   Check target map does not use enough filters while trying to search and target. So, it can be two equal targets with different filters and that sutiation can corrupt search result.

** Null target								:BUG:
   Null targets does not allowed.
   To fix try to add [[Default target][default target]]
   
** WAITING Equals target check statuses					:BUG:
   - State "WAITING"    from "IN PROGRESS"       [2016-02-16 Вт. 19:15] \\
     Wait for decision about injecting ids into database record
   'Check target' does't work correctly with equals targets, cause of database 
   search query. This problem refers to "Not enough filters in check target" bug.
   
*** DONE Fix edit target event
    CLOSED: [2016-02-17 Ср 12:56]
    So when we edit target the message with HTTP status should disappers.

*** TODO Check target on create
    Server does not checks targets on 'target create' action.

    - So as 'check target' depends on id, that does not exists after creation, front send null id, then, after querying url id saves 'with query result'.

** Add version field						       :TASK:
   DEADLINE: <2016-02-22 Пн>
   Add ~version~ field to database record.

** IN PROGRESS Split view and BL in feature/check-target 	       :TASK:
   BL not allowed in view, should extact BL function from view files on frontend.

** Encode promo and target					       :TASK:
   - To correctly handler promos and targets need to encode them into some kind of URL format.
   - Possibly create new pair of fields for encoded promo and target.

  DEADLINE: <2016-02-22 Пн>
   Implement authentification by socail networks.

** Add switch(On/Off)At front implementation			    :FEATURE:
   Add some kind of input (like calendar) to allow users to change promo (target?) switch off date.

** Default target						    :FEATURE:
   DEADLINE: <2016-02-22 Пн>
   User must create defaut target link on promo creating that will handle all 'unexpected' requests.
